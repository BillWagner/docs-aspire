## üñ•Ô∏è App model enhancements

### ‚ú® External service resources

Managing connections to external services like existing databases, APIs, or third-party endpoints has been simplified with the introduction of external service resources. This enables seamless integration of any external service into your Aspire app model with full support for service discovery and configuration management.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Connect to an existing external API
var externalApi = builder.AddExternalService("payment-api", "https://api.example.com/payment");

// Reference the external service from your project
builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApp>("webapp")
       .WithReference(externalApi);

builder.Build().Run();
```

External service resources provide a clean, consistent way to model dependencies on services that exist outside your Aspire application, making hybrid architectures and gradual migrations much more straightforward.

### üîß Enhanced YARP configuration

Building on the Yet Another Reverse Proxy (YARP) integration introduced in 9.3, this release adds powerful programmatic configuration capabilities that complement the existing JSON-based approach. You can now configure YARP routing rules, clusters, and policies directly in your app model.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Client
        A[User Browser]
    end
    subgraph ReverseProxy
        B[Reverse Proxy (YARP)]
    end
    subgraph Services
        C[Catalog Service]
        D[Basket Service]
    end

    A -- HTTP Request /catalog/... --> B
    A -- HTTP Request /basket/... --> B
    B -- Forwards /catalog/... --> C
    B -- Forwards /basket/... --> D
    C -- Response --> B
    D -- Response --> B
    B -- HTTP Response --> A
```

This diagram shows how a reverse proxy like YARP receives client requests, routes them to the appropriate backend service, and returns the response to the client.

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var catalogService = builder.AddProject<Projects.CatalogService>("catalog");
var basketService = builder.AddProject<Projects.BasketService>("basket");

// Configure YARP with fluent API
builder.AddYarp("apigateway")
       .WithReference(catalogService)
       .WithReference(basketService)
       .WithRoute("catalog", route => route
           .Match(path: "/catalog/{**catch-all}")
           .ToCluster("catalog-cluster"))
       .WithRoute("basket", route => route
           .Match(path: "/basket/{**catch-all}")  
           .ToCluster("basket-cluster"));
```

This approach provides strongly-typed configuration while maintaining the flexibility to use traditional YARP JSON configuration files when needed.

### üèóÔ∏è Enhanced resource lifecycle management

.NET Aspire 9.4 introduces improved lifecycle event handling and resource state management, building on the foundation established in 9.3. Resources now have more predictable initialization patterns and better support for custom startup sequences.

```csharp
builder.Eventing.Subscribe<InitializeResourceEvent>(myResource, async (e, ct) =>
{
    // Custom initialization logic
    await SetupCustomResource(e.Resource);
    
    // Signal the resource is ready
    await e.Notifications.PublishUpdateAsync(e.Resource,
        s => s with { State = KnownResourceStates.Running });
});
```

<!-- TODO: Fix this as it is incorrect. -->

## üìä Dashboard delights

### ‚ú® Interactive command execution

The dashboard now supports interactive command execution through a new backchannel communication system. This enables direct interaction with running services, parameter validation, and real-time feedback without leaving the dashboard environment.

```csharp
builder.AddKubernetesEnvironment("k8s")
       .WithProperties(env =>
       {
           env.DefaultImagePullPolicy = "Always";
           env.DefaultNamespace = "aspire-apps";
       });

builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("api")
       .PublishAsKubernetesService(resource =>
       {
           resource.Deployment!.Spec.Replicas = 3;
           resource.Deployment.Spec.Strategy = new()
           {
               Type = "RollingUpdate",
               RollingUpdate = new() { MaxUnavailable = 1 }
           };
       });
```

### üê≥ Docker Compose improvements

Docker Compose support has been enhanced with better parameter binding and more flexible configuration options:

- **Environment variable placeholders**: Dynamic configuration through build-time parameters
- **Service customization**: Programmatic control over container settings
- **Network configuration**: Improved container networking and service discovery

## üñ•Ô∏è CLI enhancements

builder.AddProject<Projects.ChatService>("chat")
       .WithReference(aiFoundry);
```

The integration provides:

- **Automatic role assignment**: Proper Azure RBAC configuration for AI services
- **Endpoint management**: Streamlined configuration of AI service endpoints
- **Secure authentication**: Managed identity integration for production deployments

### üîê Enhanced Azure SQL security model

Azure SQL integration has been updated with improved multi-application security handling. Instead of the previous "last one wins" administrator model, each application now receives appropriate database-level permissions while maintaining security isolation.

### üóÑÔ∏è Expanded Azure Storage capabilities

The Azure Storage integration has been refactored to provide more granular control over blob containers, queues, and tables with improved client injection patterns.

```csharp
var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage");
var blobs = storage.AddBlobs("blobs");
var imageContainer = blobs.AddBlobContainer("images");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ImageService>("images")
       .WithReference(imageContainer);
```

### üîë Key Vault enhancements

Azure Key Vault integration now supports direct environment variable injection for secrets, making it easier to securely configure applications without hardcoding sensitive values.

```csharp
var keyVault = builder.AddAzureKeyVault("secrets");
var apiSecret = keyVault.Resource.GetSecret("third-party-api-key");

builder.AddContainer("worker", "myapp/worker")
       .WithEnvironment("API_KEY", apiSecret);
```

## üß© Component integrations

### üìä Azure AI Inference client support

New client integration for Azure AI Inference services provides both direct SDK access and integration with Microsoft.Extensions.AI abstractions for flexible AI application development.

```csharp
// Register the Azure AI Inference client
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient("ai-inference")
       .AddChatClient(); // Enables IChatClient injection

// Use in minimal API
app.MapPost("/chat", async (IChatClient chatClient, ChatRequest request) =>
{
    var response = await chatClient.GetResponseAsync(request.Message);
    return Results.Ok(response);
});
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Azure App Configuration integration

Centralized configuration management is now supported through Azure App Configuration integration, enabling dynamic feature flags and configuration updates without application restarts.

```csharp
// Add Azure App Configuration
builder.AddAzureAppConfiguration("appconfig");

// Configuration is automatically available through IConfiguration
app.MapGet("/feature-status", (IConfiguration config) =>
{
    var isEnabled = config.GetValue<bool>("Features:NewUI");
    return Results.Ok(new { NewUIEnabled = isEnabled });
});
```

### üîê Expanded Key Vault client types

Additional Azure Key Vault client integrations provide specialized access to keys and certificates alongside the existing secrets client.

```csharp
// Register specialized Key Vault clients
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultKeyClient("kv");
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultCertificateClient("kv");

// Use for cryptographic operations
app.MapPost("/sign", async (KeyClient keyClient, SignRequest request) =>
{
    var key = await keyClient.GetKeyAsync("signing-key");
    // Perform signing operation
});
```

## üíî Breaking changes

With every release, we strive to make .NET Aspire better. However, some changes may break existing functionality. The following breaking changes are introduced in .NET Aspire 9.4:

### üõ°Ô∏è Azure SQL security model changes

The Azure SQL integration now uses a more secure multi-application access model. Applications receive `db_owner` role permissions instead of server administrator rights. Review your access requirements if your application relied on the previous administrator access pattern.

### üèóÔ∏è Publishing architecture updates

The publishing architecture has been modernized with new interfaces and patterns. If you have custom publishers or publishing extensions, you may need to update them to use the new `IPublishingActivityReporter` interfaces and step-based progress reporting.
